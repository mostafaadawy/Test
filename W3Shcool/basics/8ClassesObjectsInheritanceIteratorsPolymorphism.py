# Python Classes and Objects
# Python Classes/ObjectsPython is an object oriented programming language.
# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

# Create a Class
class MyClass:
  x = 5
print(MyClass)

# Create Object Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
# The __init__() Function
# All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
# Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
# The __str__() Function
# The __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.
# If the __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned:
# The string representation of an object WITHOUT the __str__() function:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1)
# The string representation of an object WITH the __str__() function:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age})"

p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1)
# Object Methods
# Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.
# Let us create a method in the Person class:
# Insert a function that prints a greeting, and execute it on the p1 object:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()
# Note: The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.
# The self Parameter
# The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.
# It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:

# Use the words mysillyobject and abc instead of self:
class Person:
  def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):
    mysillyobject.name = name
    mysillyobject.age = age

  def myfunc(abc):
    print("Hello my name is " + abc.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()
# Modify Object Properties
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.age = 40
print(p1.age)
# Delete Object Properties
del p1.age
# print(p1.age)
# Delete Objects
del p1
# The pass Statement
# class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
class Person:
  pass
# having an empty class definition like this, would raise an error without the pass statement

# Python Inheritance
# Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
# Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
# Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

#Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:
x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()
class Student(Person):
  pass
# Note: Use the pass keyword when you do not want to add any other properties or methods to the class.
x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()


# Add the __init__() Function
# So far we have created a child class that inherits the properties and methods from its parent.
# We want to add the __init__() function to the child class (instead of the pass keyword).
# Add the __init__() function to the Student class:
# When you add the __init__() function, the child class will no longer inherit the parent's __init__() function.

# class Student(Person):
#   def __init__(self, fname, lname):
#     #add properties etc.

# To keep the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function, add a call to the parent's __init__() function:
class Person1:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student1(Person1):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    Person1.__init__(self, fname, lname)

x = Student1("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()

# Use the super() Function

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()
# By using the super() function, you do not have to use the name of the parent element, it will automatically inherit the methods and properties from its parent.

# Add Properties

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = 2019

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
print(x.graduationyear)

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = year

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen", 2019)
print(x.graduationyear)

# Add Methods
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = year

  def welcome(self):
    print("Welcome", self.firstname, self.lastname, "to the class of", self.graduationyear)

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen", 2019)
x.welcome()
# Python Iterators
# An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.
# An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.
# Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__().
# Iterator vs Iterable
# Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.
# All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator:

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
myit = iter(mytuple)
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
# Strings are also iterable objects, containing a sequence of characters:
mystr = "banana"
myit = iter(mystr)
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
# Looping Through an Iterator
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for x in mytuple:
  print(x)
mystr = "banana"
for x in mystr:
  print(x)
# Create an Iterator
# To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__() to your object.
# As you have learned in the Python Classes/Objects chapter, all classes have a function called __init__(), which allows you to do some initializing when the object is being created.
# The __iter__() method acts similar, you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself.
# The __next__() method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.
class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.a = 1
    return self

  def __next__(self):
    x = self.a
    self.a += 1
    return x

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)

print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))

# StopIteration
# The example above would continue forever if you had enough next() statements, or if it was used in a for loop.
# To prevent the iteration from going on forever, we can use the StopIteration statement.
# In the __next__() method, we can add a terminating condition to raise an error if the iteration is done a specified number of times:
class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.a = 1
    return self

  def __next__(self):
    if self.a <= 20:
      x = self.a
      self.a += 1
      return x
    else:
      raise StopIteration

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)

for x in myiter:
  print(x)

# print(next(myiter))

# Python Polymorphism
# The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes
# An example of a Python function that can be used on different objects is the len() function.

# Class Polymorphism
# Polymorphism is often used in Class methods, where we can have multiple classes with the same method name.
# For example, say we have three classes: Car, Boat, and Plane, and they all have a method called move():
# Different classes with the same method:
class Car:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Drive!")

class Boat:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Sail!")

class Plane:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Fly!")

car1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang")       #Create a Car class
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza", "Touring 20") #Create a Boat class
plane1 = Plane("Boeing", "747")     #Create a Plane class

for x in (car1, boat1, plane1):
  x.move()
# Look at the for loop at the end. Because of polymorphism we can execute the same method for all three classes.


# Inheritance Class Polymorphism
# What about classes with child classes with the same name? Can we use polymorphism there?
# Yes. If we use the example above and make a parent class called Vehicle, and make Car, Boat, Plane child classes of Vehicle, the child classes inherits the Vehicle methods, but can override them  
# Create a class called Vehicle and make Car, Boat, Plane child classes of Vehicle:
class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Move!")

class Car(Vehicle):
  pass

class Boat(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print("Sail!")

class Plane(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print("Fly!")

car1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang") #Create a Car object
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza", "Touring 20") #Create a Boat object
plane1 = Plane("Boeing", "747") #Create a Plane object

for x in (car1, boat1, plane1):
  print(x.brand)
  print(x.model)
  x.move()

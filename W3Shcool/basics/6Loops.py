# Python For Loops
# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
# This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
# With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    break
  print(x)
# The continue Statement
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x)

# The range() Function
for x in range(6):
  print(x)
for x in range(2, 6):
  print(x)
for x in range(2, 30, 3):
  print(x)
# Else in For Loop
for x in range(6):
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")
# Note: The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement.
for x in range(6):
  if x == 3: break

  print("Finally finished!")

adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:

# The pass Statement
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
# having an empty for loop like this, would raise an error without the pass statement

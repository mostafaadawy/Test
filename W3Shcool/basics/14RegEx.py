# Python RegEx
# A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
# RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.
# RegEx Module
# Python has a built-in package called re, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.
# Import the re module:
import re
#Check if the string starts with "The" and ends with "Spain":
txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("^The.*Spain$", txt)
if x:
  print("YES! We have a match!")
else:
  print("No match")

# RegEx Functions
# The re module offers a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match:

# Function	Description
# findall	Returns a list containing all matches
# search	Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string
# split	Returns a list where the string has been split at each match
# sub	Replaces one or many matches with a string

# Metacharacters
# Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:

# Character	Description	Example	Try it
# []	A set of characters	"[a-m]"	
# \	Signals a special sequence (can also be used to escape special characters)	"\d"	
# .	Any character (except newline character)	"he..o"	
# ^	Starts with	"^hello"	
# $	Ends with	"planet$"	
# *	Zero or more occurrences	"he.*o"	
# +	One or more occurrences	"he.+o"	
# ?	Zero or one occurrences	"he.?o"	
# {}	Exactly the specified number of occurrences	"he.{2}o"	
# |	Either or	"falls|stays"	
# ()	Capture and group	 	 
# Special Sequences
# A special sequence is a \ followed by one of the characters in the list below, and has a special meaning:

# Character	Description	Example	Try it
# \A	Returns a match if the specified characters are at the beginning of the string	"\AThe"	
# \b	Returns a match where the specified characters are at the beginning or at the end of a word
# (the "r" in the beginning is making sure that the string is being treated as a "raw string")	r"\bain"

# r"ain\b"	

# \B	Returns a match where the specified characters are present, but NOT at the beginning (or at the end) of a word
# (the "r" in the beginning is making sure that the string is being treated as a "raw string")	r"\Bain"

# r"ain\B"	

# \d	Returns a match where the string contains digits (numbers from 0-9)	"\d"	
# \D	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain digits	"\D"	
# \s	Returns a match where the string contains a white space character	"\s"	
# \S	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain a white space character	"\S"	
# \w	Returns a match where the string contains any word characters (characters from a to Z, digits from 0-9, and the underscore _ character)	"\w"	
# \W	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain any word characters	"\W"	
# \Z	Returns a match if the specified characters are at the end of the string	"Spain\Z"	
# Sets
# A set is a set of characters inside a pair of square brackets [] with a special meaning:

# Set	Description	Try it
# [arn]	Returns a match where one of the specified characters (a, r, or n) is present	
# [a-n]	Returns a match for any lower case character, alphabetically between a and n	
# [^arn]	Returns a match for any character EXCEPT a, r, and n	
# [0123]	Returns a match where any of the specified digits (0, 1, 2, or 3) are present	
# [0-9]	Returns a match for any digit between 0 and 9	
# [0-5][0-9]	Returns a match for any two-digit numbers from 00 and 59	
# [a-zA-Z]	Returns a match for any character alphabetically between a and z, lower case OR upper case	
# [+]	In sets, +, *, ., |, (), $,{} has no special meaning, so [+] means: return a match for any + character in the string
